# About NV Data Technologies LLC
NV Data Technologies LLC was founded from a simple intersection of passions: a lifelong love of bowling and a deep appreciation for high-level statistics, engineering, and data visualization. This blend inspired the creation of Pinlytics—our first product—built in 2025 as a personal passion project aimed at bringing meaningful, intuitive analytics to everyday bowlers. As we continue refining Pinlytics, NV Data Technologies is committed to developing innovative, practical applications that use data to make life easier, smarter, and more insightful. Our mission is to share useful tools with the world, one thoughtfully designed product at a time.
